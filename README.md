# Inventory Management System

`ACADEMIC PROJECT`

## Scenario

Inventory management tools are crucial because they assist businesses in
effectively tracking and managing their inventory, which can help them avoid having
too much or too little stocks on hand.

You are required to develop a simple system to list all the inventories that are
available in the organization. 
- You may categorize the inventory based on priority or
based on certain criteria such as finished goods, ordering, goods need to order and other
criteria that suitable based on the organization nature that you are focusing on for the
system.
- Your system needs to alert or highlight the goods that need to be ordered.
- Goods that are less than 3 items should be highlighted or prompted by the system to order from
the vendor.
- Every sale of the item needs to be auto deducted from the inventory system.
- You are free to design the system based on your creativity in terms of interface design
and system functionality.
